# HP ProBook 640 G2 successful hackintosh attempt.

Here I provide my working configuration for running macOS Monterrey on a HP ProBook 640 G2 laptop.

Some features:
- As stable as a Linux distro (coming from Debian).
- All trackpad gestures, keyboard shortcuts and special keys support.
- Battery management and visualization.
- WiFi and Bluetooth fixes.
- Working audio (both internal and external devices).

To use this configuration, follow [Dortania's Installation Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) and drop the `EFI` folder in the FAT32 partition named "OPENCORE", paired with another partition containing the macOS Monterrey image (Method 2).

Feel free to fork, re-use and extend this configuration.
